The purpose of this project is to make all the features of PHREEQC available online, in an interface that works right away. No need to download or install anything. 

Phreeqc Web consists of a Python script which executes IPhreeqc and it is designed to run out-of-the-box in a jupiter notebook hosted on Google Colab, with all the capabilities of the desktop graphical user interface.

The implementation has been possibile through the Python package "phreeqpy" (https://www.phreeqpy.com/).

# Getting started 

Phreeqc Web is run in a Jupiter notebook which can be accessed in Google Colab and run here &#8594; [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1e-j7Yw3rTu8PTON-XK4d7FBYb8Z-0Yyd?usp=sharing)

The notebook contains 5 examples:

1) Visualize the outputs of a simple reaction
2) Automatic replace inputs 
3) Make a breakthrough plot (example 11 of Phreeqc's manual)
4) Plot spatial profiles (uphill diffusion example)
5) Simulate electrokinetic transport 

Each example is independent and provides a starting point to develop more complex applications. 

# Do I need to compile IPhreeqc to make it work? 

No, Phreeqc Web is ready to run. Actually, the source code of Iphreeqc is taken from the USGS website (https://www.usgs.gov/software/phreeqc-version-3) and it is automatically compiled using GitHub actions (available for this repo here: https://github.com/rispr/phreeqc_web/blob/main/.github/workflows/compile_on_upload.yml). Every time a new source code is uploaded in this repository it is automatically compiled and a Linux library is generated (https://github.com/rispr/phreeqc_web/tree/main/Iphreeqc_compiled) which is ready to be used by IPhreeqc, just by changing a link in Google Colab.
